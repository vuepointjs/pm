# VuePoint.js Project Management - General Issues Bucket

This repo exists simply as a master bucket for VuePoint.js **Issues**. Rather than hunting for Issues across various individual repos, the preference is to create Issues here, especially pre-planned Issues.

In an Agile/Scrum sense, this is a particularly good place for Issues that are considered an **epic** or a **story**.

## GitHub Issues

**Issues** in GitHub are a very flexible item. They start with a **Title**. Try to keep it short and use a `Noun - Verb` format.

They can also be assigned **Labels** to organize them and flag them for certain purposes. A Labeling convention is very important. Here are some of the Labels we'll use.

### Epics

Epics are the largest unit of work breakdown. If something is going to take more than 2 weeks, consider making it an **epic** by *labelling it* as such: **"epic"**.

### Stories

**User Stories** are the next largest unit when breaking down work. Generally a story should be something that takes less than 2 weeks, but that's not a hard-and-fast rule. Create stories by opening an Issue and marking it with a **"story"** Label.

Consider using the internal "checklist" or [**"task list"** feature of GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-task-lists/) (the `- [ ] ...` markdown syntax) to enumerate tasks *within* the body of a story.

This eliminates the need to create a bunch of separate Issues labeled **"task"**.

However, because an Issue assignment generally only makes sense for a single person, a **"story"** Issue may not always work (though it *is* possible to assign multiple people). And depending on how long the tasks are anticipated to take and thus how big the story is, it may be best to create separate Issues labeled **"task"** anyway, even in the case where they are all assigned to the same person.

### Tasks and Bugs

These are the lowest level of work breakdown. Sometimes tasks can simply be represented as a checklist/task list in the body of a story as described above. Use judgment to determine the best way to break things down... separate Issues labelled as **"task"**, or a task list within a **"story"**.
